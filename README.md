## Why Mini-Term

1. **Heavyweight tools are overkill** — All-in-on-AI users only need a terminal to run their agents, yet are forced to fire up heavy IDEs like VS Code / IDEA that are large and memory-hungry.
2. **No awareness of concurrent agents** — When several Claude / Codex sessions run at once, there's no clear way to see which agent has finished.
3. **Project switching is clumsy** — The system terminal lacks multi-project organization, tabs, and split-pane management.

Mini-Term solves all of the above with one lightweight desktop app.

## Features

### Terminal Core

- **Multi-tab management** — A dedicated tab per project, drag to reorder, status icons at a glance.
- **Recursive splitting** — Arbitrarily nested horizontal / vertical splits, drag to adjust ratios via Allotment.
- **High-performance rendering** — xterm.js v6 + WebGL acceleration, automatic fallback to Canvas.
- **100k-line scrollback buffer** — Intercepts the CSI 3J (ED3) sequence so scrollback survives when TUIs like Claude / Codex / OpenCode clear the screen; intercepts alternate-screen switching so TUI output stays in the main buffer, keeping the scrollbar and scrollback always available.
- **Terminal caching** — Switching projects / tabs / panes never rebuilds the xterm instance, so existing content is preserved; lazy startup creates a PTY only for the currently visible pane, avoiding the slowdown of spawning more terminals the more history projects you have.
- **Project-switch caching** — FileTree / GitHistory data is cached per project, so switching back to a visited project renders with zero latency; directory loading and Git status run in parallel, and Git repo scan results are cached for 30 seconds.
- **Copy & paste** — `Ctrl+Shift+C/V` (macOS `⌘+Shift+C/V`) shortcuts + context menu, with "Copy" auto-greyed when nothing is selected; an optional "Smart `Ctrl+C/V`" mode (copy when there's a selection, interrupt the program when there isn't, and `Ctrl+V` pastes directly); on Windows, large multi-line pastes are chunked to prevent ConPTY from dropping lines.
- **Long-text paste** — When clipboard text is ≥10 lines or ≥2000 chars, it is automatically saved to a temporary `.txt` and a quoted file path is pasted instead, avoiding the performance and paste-bracket issues of feeding huge content straight to AI tools.
- **Image paste** — Detects screenshots in the clipboard, saves them to a temporary PNG via the Win32 API, and pastes a quoted path; compatible with non-standard formats such as PinPix.
- **File drag & drop** — Dragging a file from the file tree or system file explorer onto the terminal inserts its quoted absolute path, targeting the exact split pane and handling paths with spaces.
- **Multiple shell profiles** — Windows (cmd / powershell / pwsh), macOS (zsh / bash), Linux (bash / sh) and more, freely added or removed.

### SSH Connections

- **Connection management** — The top-bar "SSH" button opens a management dialog to add / edit / delete SSH connections, with host / port / username / password / private key / group fields, persisted to the config file.
- **Quick connect** — A right-click "SSH Connect" submenu inside the terminal lists saved connections by group; selecting one assembles the `ssh` command and launches the session right in the current terminal.
- **Password auto-fill** — For connections with a saved password, the backend scans PTY output for the password prompt and writes the password back automatically, once per session, stopping on a wrong password to avoid hammering the server with bad credentials.
- **Private-key permission handling** — When connecting with a private key, the key is copied to a permission-tightened temporary copy (Windows `icacls` / Unix `0600`) to bypass OpenSSH's "UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE" rejection, without modifying your original key file.
- **Advanced capabilities** — Key-file login (`ssh -i`) and connection grouping.
- **SSH MCP Server** — Exposes saved SSH connections as MCP tools to AI agents running in the terminal (Claude Code / Codex). The project right-click "Link SSH" menu enables them per project and limits visibility to the selected connections; the built-in `mt-ssh-mcp` sidecar (a stdio MCP server based on the official rmcp) provides `ssh_list_connections`, `ssh_exec`, `ssh_upload` and `ssh_download`, where `ssh_exec` reuses password / private-key auth with timeouts, output capping, and an audit log; `ssh_upload` / `ssh_download` transfer single files over SFTP (streamed in chunks for constant memory, so large files work, unlike base64-echoing through `ssh_exec`), download writes straight to a local path on disk, and a hard guard refuses to ever transfer mini-term's own `config.json` (which holds all saved SSH credentials); enabling / disabling writes idempotently into Claude's `.mcp.json` and Codex's `.codex/config.toml` using named markers. **Since v0.4.10 the sidecar maintains an in-process SSH session pool** (russh 0.61 + tokio): the first call to a connection does one TCP handshake + auth (~seconds), and subsequent commands cost only an RTT; sessions are recycled after 10 minutes idle or 2 hours max, and gracefully `disconnect` when the sidecar exits.
- **SSH remote projects** — Add a directory on a remote server directly as a mini-term project: the "Add Remote Project" dialog picks a saved SSH connection and takes a remote POSIX path, validating that the directory exists over SSH before saving; the file tree lazy-loads over SFTP (an inline loading spinner on expand, manual refresh, root `.gitignore` filtering); the terminal connects via `ssh -t` and lands straight in the project directory, with a one-click reconnect overlay after a disconnection; the Sessions panel merges the remote machine's Claude / Codex sessions chronologically, with content viewing supported; deleting the referenced connection shows the project in a "broken-link" state rather than failing silently; under the hood it shares the extracted `mt-ssh` crate (persistent russh session pool + SFTP primitives) with the SSH MCP sidecar, and remote cache keys mix in the connection id so identical paths on two servers never cross-contaminate.

### SSH MCP SFTP Tools

After a project is linked to one or more SSH connections, agents can use these single-file SFTP tools:

```json
{"connection":"prod","local_path":"C:/tmp/app.tar.gz","remote_path":"/tmp/app.tar.gz","timeout_secs":300}
```

Use that payload with `ssh_upload` to copy local to remote. For `ssh_download`, swap the direction: `remote_path` is the source on the SSH host and `local_path` is the destination on the machine running mini-term. Use `ssh_list_connections` first when the connection name is unknown.

### WSL Support (Windows)

- **WSL directories as project roots** — Supports adding WSL paths in both `\\wsl$\<distro>\<unix-path>` and `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\<unix-path>` forms as projects; the displayed path automatically strips the `\\?\UNC\` verbatim prefix, and the file tree expands and previews normally.
- **Automatic wsl.exe launch** — When the cwd is detected as a WSL UNC path, `create_pty` ignores the user-configured shell (cmd / pwsh, etc.) and forces `wsl.exe -d <distro> --cd <unix-path>`, so the cwd truly lands inside WSL (`pwd` shows `/home/<user>/proj` rather than `C:\Windows`), consistent with Windows Terminal's `MangleStartingDirectoryForWSL` behavior; the distro name is parsed directly from the path without invoking `wsl -l -v`, and a one-time toast appears when the rewrite triggers.
- **Known limitations** — AI process detection (ai-working / ai-idle states) relies on the host's `process_monitor` reading child process names; after a wsl.exe launch, the `claude` / `codex` processes inside the WSL VM are out of the monitor's scope, so AI status stops working. `notify` file watching very likely loses events on the WSL 9P filesystem, so the file tree needs a manual refresh. Verified only on WSL2; WSL1 compatibility is not guaranteed.

### File Search

- **Global search** — Triggered by `Ctrl+Shift+F` (macOS `⌘+Shift+F`) or the file-tree toolbar button, supporting both filename and file-content search modes.
- **Regex matching** — Toggle between substring / regex modes, with matched keywords highlighted in the results.
- **Streaming results** — The backend walks the file tree with the `ignore` crate and pushes results in batches every 50 entries or 100ms, cancellable at any time.
- **Content grouping** — Content-search mode groups matched line numbers by file; clicking a result previews and jumps straight to the matched line.

### AI Process Awareness

- **Hook event system** — Integrates the official Claude Code / Codex Hook APIs to receive AI tool events (SessionStart / End, ToolUse, etc.), which is more precise and timely than process polling; the built-in `miniterm-hook` CLI is called by the hook system to POST events to a local server; the settings UI registers / unregisters the hook config with one click, merging rather than overwriting your existing hooks.
- **Real-time status detection** — Hook-first with a 500ms process-polling fallback, auto-detecting Claude / Codex / OpenCode and showing idle / working / error states.
- **Status aggregation** — Aggregated layer by layer from pane → tab → project, with priority `error > ai-working > ai-idle > idle`.
- **Completion notification trio** — Fires the moment an AI task goes working → idle:
  - A bottom-right toast desktop notification (only for inactive projects, deduplicated per project).
  - A DONE badge in the project list, cleared on click.
  - Taskbar flashing (Windows) / Dock bouncing (macOS), triggered only when the window is unfocused.
  - A notification sound (a default tone synthesized via the Web Audio API, with support for a custom audio file).
  - All notification toggles are independently configurable, managed on a dedicated "AI Completion Notifications" page in the settings center.
- **Session enter/exit detection** — Recognizes entering AI via command echo; recognizes exit via a double `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+D` or `exit` / `quit` / `:quit` / `/logout`.
- **Session history** — Reads local Claude / Codex history records, with a right-click to copy the resume command for quick continuation; the first screen renders only 20 entries, loading more automatically as you scroll to the bottom.
- **Session viewer** — A right-click "View" shows the full conversation, with User as plain text and Assistant rendered as Markdown (external links open in the system default browser after a confirmation prompt), supporting `Ctrl+F` search highlighting and quick navigation between User messages.
- **WSL sessions** — Reads Claude / Codex session history inside WSL distros directly from Windows (no `wsl.exe` spawn — via `\\wsl$` UNC plus registry-based distro enumeration): WSL-rooted projects auto-derive the distro and path with zero configuration; Windows-path projects pick a distro via the right-click "WSL Sessions" submenu and are scanned through `/mnt` path mapping, with in-session cwd verification to prevent cross-project mixing; WSL sessions merge chronologically with local ones under a WSL badge, a header spinner shows while loading, and viewing session content is supported too.
- **AI task markers** — Each time the user presses Enter inside an AI session, a marker is dropped in xterm; the ⚑ button at the tab's top-right drops down the list of past submissions, and clicking one or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+↑/↓` (macOS `⌘+Shift+↑/↓`) jumps between markers, briefly highlighting the target line.

### cc-connect Integration

Remotely drive the AI agents running on your machine through IM platforms (Feishu / Slack / Telegram / Discord / DingTalk / WeChat, etc.), bridged with the upstream [chenhg5/cc-connect](https://github.com/chenhg5/cc-connect). All entry points are gathered in the top-bar "Connect" button dialog.

- **Process management (zero-config)** — Start / stop / restart / test-connection / edit config.toml from within the "Connect" dialog, optionally auto-spawned on mini-term startup; when the executable / config paths are left blank, it prefers the bundled Windows `cc-connect` sidecar, then falls back to `cc-connect` on PATH and `~/.cc-connect/config.toml`, working with zero configuration; on Windows it resolves the npm script shell (`.cmd` / `.ps1`) via PATH × PATHEXT, and stop / restart use `taskkill /T` to kill the whole process tree to avoid orphans; closing mini-term does not kill it, keeping IM available continuously.
- **One-click project import** — The "Connect" dialog lists all mini-term projects; check / select-all to batch-import in one click (appending `[[projects]]` via `toml_edit` to preserve comments, a single disk write + a single cc-connect restart, with an 8-char hash suffix auto-added on name conflicts), or import individually; imported entries show "● Imported" and can be removed in one click. Each imported project comes with a **placeholder Telegram platform** (cc-connect requires at least one platform per project or cold start fails); after importing, replace the placeholder with a real IM platform in the Dashboard to enable it.
- **Embedded Dashboard** — "Open Dashboard" in the "Connect" dialog opens cc-connect's own web console in an iframe (already authenticated), letting you configure IM platforms / switch providers / manage cron directly inside mini-term without opening a browser; it `createPortal`s to `document.body` to bypass the backdrop-filter of Fluent 2's `[data-panel]` and ensure full-screen coverage; keep-alive close uses `display:none` without unmounting, avoiding re-login.
- **Half-synced state handling** — Even if cc-connect's restart fails on project import / removal, the frontend keeps the local `projectLinks` based on the `tomlWritten` / `deletedOk` branches and shows a warning toast explaining the restart failure; the change takes effect the next time cc-connect starts.
- **Graceful degradation** — When cc-connect isn't running, buttons like Import / Dashboard are greyed out with a "start cc-connect first" hint rather than crashing; when config.toml has no `[management].token`, it gives a friendly diagnostic guiding the user to run `cc-connect web` to generate one automatically.

### Project Management

- **Project list** — Manage multiple project directories in the left sidebar, switch workspaces in one click, and restore the last active project on restart.
- **Drag to add projects** — Drag a folder from the file explorer onto the project list to add it quickly, with automatic detection of files / folders / duplicate projects and visual feedback.
- **Nested groups** — Up to 3 levels of project grouping, drag to reorder, collapse / expand, with a group context menu to add a project directly into that group.
- **File tree** — An integrated directory browser with natural sorting (V1 → V2 → V10 rather than lexicographic), nested `.gitignore` greying (ignore rules and `!pattern` allowlists at every sub-directory level take effect, consistent with git behavior), and live refresh via `notify` file watching.
- **File operations** — Create / rename / delete files and folders, drag files or folders onto another folder to move them or onto empty file-tree space to move them back to the project root, and view contents inside the file tree (Markdown rendering supports HTML tags and external images, external links open in the system default browser after a confirmation prompt, image formats are shown directly, HTML files preview in an iframe with relative-path resources auto-resolved, and binary / oversized files get a friendly notice).
- **Open in external editor** — A button at the top-right of the file tree opens the current project in your configured editor (VS Code by default), with the path customizable under "Settings → System → External Editor"; files can be opened with the system default app.
- **Project-level environment variables** — The project context menu "Environment Variables…" opens a management dialog with a row-level `[enable checkbox][key][value][✕]` layout, injecting per-project variables into the PTY child process when starting that project's terminal; strict POSIX validation (key matches `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`, no `MINITERM_` prefix, no `WSLENV`, no duplicates within a project, and value forbids `\n/\r/\0`); the Rust side adds a defensive `MINITERM_`-prefix + `WSLENV` filter, so even hand-editing `config.json` to bypass frontend validation cannot break the hook protocol or WSLENV concatenation; under WSL projects, variables pass through to Linux bash via the WSLENV mechanism (`/u` is one-way without path translation; an `export` of the same name in `~/.bashrc` will override).

### Git Integration

- **File status** — The file tree shows Git status colors (modified / added / deleted / conflict).
- **Change diff** — A detailed diff of working-tree file changes, parsed at the hunk/line level, with side-by-side / inline dual views; side-by-side mode supports dragging to adjust the split ratio, and the font size follows the terminal font setting.
- **Commit history** — Browse the repo's commit log with cursor-based pagination (30 entries by default).
- **Commit diff** — View the file changes of any commit, switching file by file.
- **Branch info** — Local / remote branch lists.
- **Source control panel** — A VS Code-style Changes panel grouping Staged / Changes / Untracked, supporting per-file and bulk stage / unstage / discard, `Ctrl+Enter` to commit quickly, and toggling between list and tree views.
- **Pull / Push** — In-row buttons sync with the remote in one click, with a refresh button to reload the commit log and branch info.
- **Multi-repo discovery** — Automatically scans all Git repos under the project directory (recursing 5 levels, skipping `node_modules` etc.).

### Appearance & Configuration

- **Icon sidebar + three-column layout** — A persistent icon bar on the far left (collapse middle column / Sessions / Git / Settings / SSH / Connect); the middle column stacks Projects over Files and collapses as a whole; the terminal sits on the right. Sessions / Git are now floating drawers that slide out from the right edge over the terminal (mutually exclusive single panel, left-edge drag to resize with persisted width, ✕ to close), with a blue vertical bar indicating the active state.
- **Three theme modes** — Auto (follows the system) / Light / Dark, with Dark based on a Warm Carbon palette and a custom CSS-variable system; the native Windows title bar (DWM Immersive Dark Mode) follows the theme automatically, with no first-frame light flash for dark-mode users on startup.
- **Blueprint skin** — An optional sci-fi Blueprint skin with a grid background + corner markers + glow effects, supporting both dark and light modes, with the terminal palette switching in sync.
- **Independent font tuning** — The UI and terminal font sizes (10-20px) / families are adjustable separately, and the terminal can optionally follow the UI theme.
- **Ligatures** — A terminal ligature toggle that composes glyphs like `==` `=>` `!=` `->` when enabled, requiring a font with a calt table (Fira Code / JetBrains Mono); fully supported on Windows, while macOS / Linux use a 60-entry Iosevka fallback due to webview API limitations.
- **Layout persistence** — Split ratios, tabs, and window size / position are saved automatically and restored on restart (`tauri-plugin-window-state`).
- **Close confirmation** — A confirmation before closing the window, flushing all project layouts to prevent accidental loss.
- **Update check** — Fetches the GitHub Release on startup; when a new version is available a highlighted hint appears on the icon sidebar (click to download), and the version number is written into the native window title.
- **Bilingual UI (English / 中文)** — A one-click language toggle under "Settings → System" instantly re-renders the entire interface; the language is auto-detected from the system on first launch and remembered across restarts. Every page and feature is fully translated, with a lightweight built-in i18n layer (no extra runtime dependency).
- **Settings center** — A unified SettingsModal managing all toggles: theme, fonts, shells, AI notifications, and more.

## Getting Started

### Direct Download

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/dswcpp/mini-term/releases) page to download the latest installer.

> **Platform support note**
> - **Windows** — The primary supported platform with guaranteed usability; daily development and testing all happen on Windows.
> - **macOS / Linux** — Supported at the code level (Tauri bundle targets = `all`), but **not well polished**, lacking thorough refinement; Issue reports are welcome.

#### macOS Installation Note

After downloading the `.dmg` and double-clicking to open it, if the system shows **"Mini-Term" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin**, the file is not actually corrupted — the Release artifact simply isn't signed with an Apple Developer ID and is rejected by Gatekeeper due to the quarantine flag.

Drag the `.app` into `/Applications`, then run this once in a terminal to lift the restriction:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Mini-Term.app
```

After that it launches normally on double-click. You'll need to run it again after each version upgrade.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

```
User keystroke → xterm.onData → invoke('write_pty') → Rust PTY writer
Rust PTY reader → 16ms batch buffer → emit('pty-output') → term.write()
Process exit       → emit('pty-exit')          → store.updatePaneStatusByPty('error')
Process monitor 500ms → emit('pty-status-change') → StatusDot update
File change notify  → emit('fs-change')          → FileTree refresh
ai-working → ai-idle → Toast + DONE Tag + requestUserAttention

### Status Priority

Terminal pane status is aggregated from leaf nodes up to the tab and project levels:

```
error > ai-working > ai-idle > idle
```

### Layout Model

```
App
├── ActivityBar (persistent far-left, panel visibility toggles + AI status badge)
├── Allotment three columns
│   ├── Left: ProjectList (projects + groups + sessions + DONE badge)
│   ├── Middle: FileTree (directory browsing + Git status + file operations)
│   └── Right
    ├── TabBar (tab management)
    ├── SplitLayout (recursive SplitNode tree)
    │   └── TerminalInstance × N (xterm.js + context menu)
    └── GitHistory (repo tree + commit history + Pull/Push)

ToastContainer floats at the bottom-right; SettingsModal overlays globally.
```
